# NationGyms
Gym Management Application

C# database application to manage both members and staff data. The topic I chose was “Fitness” and created a member management application for the staff at “NationGyms” to utilize when adding and organizing their members and their data. My application consists of 5 Main forms: Home, add member, Search database, Graphs, And gym plan. With additional forms for the login and the settings. The application includes two Databases to store member data and staff login, from which the application frequently references and queries. My Program includes many of Nielsen’s Heuristics for improved UI design, such as Nielsen’s 4 law “Consistency and standard” (Nielsen, 1995 ) where I made it my priority to make each forms designs consistent to one another by following the same design template .

Features implemented and fully functional:
1.	Staff Login System
2.	User’s name and access displayed on header
3.	Add, Edit, and delete members
4.	Query members database from form
5.	Displays a dynamic chart (updates live according to database)
6.	Staff able to edit gym plans perks 
7.	Edits made to gym plan perks saved on external text file 
8.	Staff able to change password (Password validation included)
9.	Staff able to change interface colour
